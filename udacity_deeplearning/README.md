These projects are part of Udacity Deep Learning course.

In every project I add my own code to enhance the project or to get more exposure to  the concepts. 
I will updating all the projects in which I have made some changes or added some more sections.


If you are new to machine learning Udacity has some wonderful introductory courses, start with the first one.

  - Introdcution to Machine Learning by Sabastian Thrun and Katie
  - Deep Learning Course by Google, This is an excellent course and I suggest taking it to get started with TensorFlow.
